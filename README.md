<h1>Implementation of various important data structures using python.</h1>

<h2>Here is the description about this repository:</h2>
<p>-> You will find all the important data structures like linked list, stack, queue, priority queue,
      tree(binary tree and generic tree), graph etc.</p>
   
<p>-> You will find both the problem and the solution(multiple solutions according to multiple approaches).</p>

-> I have used jupter notebook to write all these code.

Note: This is all the code that i wrote while taking course "Data Structures and Algorithms in python" on Coding Ninjas
